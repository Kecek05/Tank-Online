    details: "Sortify 1.0 is here! This first release introduces a comprehensive
      toolset designed to streamline your workflow in Unity by enhancing the organization,
      customization, and management of complex hierarchies. Below is a summary of
      the core features and improvements available in this initial version:\n\nKey
      Features\n\u2022 Color Coding for Objects: Easily assign colors to objects
      in the hierarchy, improving visual organization and making important items
      stand out.\n\u2022 Custom Icons: Add icons to objects in the hierarchy for
      faster identification and enhanced visual cues.\n\u2022 Favorites Hierarchy:
      Mark frequently accessed objects as favorites and quickly locate them in the
      dedicated Favorites window.\n\u2022 Mini Inspector: Access a compact Inspector
      directly from the hierarchy to view and edit component settings without leaving
      the hierarchy view.\n\u2022 Persistent Unique IDs: Each object is assigned
      a unique, persistent identifier, ensuring preferences and settings are consistently
      applied across sessions.\n\u2022 Custom Attributes: Leverage a variety of custom
      attributes (such as toggles, progress bars, headers, and buttons) to create
      organized and interactive Inspector layouts tailored to your needs.\n\u2022
      Personal Notes: Attach notes to objects directly in the hierarchy, helping
      you manage project details and keep track of important information.\n\u2022
      Settings Popup: Access a centralized settings popup for each object to customize
      style, color, icon, and other attributes, all from one place.\n\nAdditional
      Improvements\n\u2022 Enhanced Hierarchy Performance: Optimized performance
      of the hierarchy when using Sortify, ensuring smooth navigation and interaction
      even in large scenes.\n\u2022 Local Data Storage: Sortify saves user-specific
      settings locally, allowing for customized workflows while keeping preferences
      isolated from project files.\n\nQuality of Life Updates\n\u2022 Quick Add Component
      Section: Add commonly used components directly from the settings popup, saving
      time and improving workflow efficiency.\n\u2022 Advanced Progress Bars: Include
      real-time progress bars (e.g., health, mana) within the Inspector for visual
      monitoring of important values.\n\nThis initial release of Sortify brings a
      powerful set of tools to the Unity ecosystem, aimed at simplifying project
      management and enhancing productivity for all Unity users."
